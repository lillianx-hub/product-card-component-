### What I learned

I learned to use the flexbox and CSS grid to adjust the layoout and HTML architecture.

```html
<h1>Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I continued practice in fontend dev and in the future, I want to do the php sql and practice more js.
